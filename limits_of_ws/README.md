### Note:
If running grid search with Cosine as an end model with parallelism enablabled, the following combination of hyperparameters may cause GPU memory issue:
{"optimizer_lr" : [1e-5], "optimizer_weight_decay" : [1e-4], "batch_size" : [32], "real_batch_size" : [8],  "teacher_update" : [100], "lambda" : [0.01] "thresh" : [0.2], "margin‚Äù : [1.0], "mu" : [1.0]}
