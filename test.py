st = "So disappointed. The room was cold  the massage was erratic and had no flow. There were times when the pressure was fine- like in the very beginning when she asked- but then it was so light it was almost tickling! She seemed to want to focus on areas other than requested and seemed to need to use a stool to sit down a lot. It really felt like she wasn't into it so as awkward as it was- I asked her to stop. When I went to check out  I stood at the desk for over 5 minutes while 2 ladies behind the desk were on the phone. I was surprised by their lack of interest that the massage was substandard and they proceeded to charge me. I guess I'm grateful it was only the $30 for 30 minutes of massage but there was a sign in front of me that 'if your massage was unsatisfactory  let us know so we can make it right for you' That did not happen. I will not be back."
